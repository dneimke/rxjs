# rxjs
A repo to store the samples from the [Getting Started RxJs course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/reactive-programming-rxjs-getting-started/table-of-contents) on Pluralsight

Some of the things that were taught included:

**[Creation](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html#creating)**
------------------------------
- arrays, events, create method
- fromPromise - projects a Promise into an Observable
- defer - factory method for making Observables lazy


**[Operators](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html)**
------------------------------
- map, filter, delay
- flatMap - projects an Observable onto a single output Observable stream
- retry, retryWhen
- take, takeWhile
- delay

Another really cool resource for seeing the potential of reactive programming is [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNnGb5WmfGk&t=3s "From imperative to reactive thinking") by [@toddmotto](https://twitter.com/toddmotto) and [@MrJamesHenry](https://twitter.com/MrJamesHenry)
